# 🐕 The DOGE Catcher  
**Turning complex government grant data into clear, actionable insights for everyday citizens.**

This project was built for the **[Hackathon Name]**!

## 🎯 Inspiration

Government funding decisions often happen quietly—with real consequences for our communities. We wanted to give everyday citizens the same awareness and response speed that lobbying groups and large organizations have.

By using public grant and spending data from DOGE (Department of Government Expenditures), we created a tool that highlights impactful grant changes and makes it easy for citizens to **understand, respond, and mobilize**.

## 🧠 What It Does

The **DOGE Catcher**:

- Tracks DOGE government **grant cancellation updates**
- Displays the results when a grant is **reduced, cancelled, or reallocated**
- Explains the **real-world impacts** (positive and negative)
- Helps users take **action**:
  - Draft letters to Congress
  - Generate outreach messages
  - Create shareable social media summaries

Citizens get **clarity + a next step**, immediately.
